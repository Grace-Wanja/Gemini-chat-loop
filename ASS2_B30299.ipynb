      "### How to Run:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Save the Code:** Save the code above as `harba_inventory_app.py`.\n",
      "2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n",
      "3.  **Run:** Execute the script using Python:\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    python harba_inventory_app.py\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`InventoryManager` Class:**\n",
      "    *   **`__init__(self, db_name)`:** Initializes the database connection and creates the `inventory` table if it doesn't exist.\n",
      "    *   **`_connect()`:** Handles connecting to the SQLite database file.\n",
      "    *   **`_create_table()`:** Defines the schema for the `inventory` table.\n",
      "        *   `item_id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing integer (unique ID for each item).\n",
      "        *   `name`: Text, cannot be null.\n",
      "        *   `category`: Text (e.g., \"Electronics\", \"Clothing\").\n",
      "        *   `quantity`: Integer, cannot be null.\n",
      "        *   `price`: Real (float) for decimal prices, cannot be null.\n",
      "        *   `supplier`: Text.\n",
      "        *   `last_updated`: Text, stores timestamp for last modification.\n",
      "    *   **`close_connection()`:** Closes the database connection cleanly.\n",
      "    *   **`add_item(...)`:** Inserts a new record into the `inventory` table. Includes a `last_updated` timestamp.\n",
      "    *   **`get_all_items()`:** Fetches all records from the table.\n",
      "    *   **`get_item_by_id(item_id)`:** Fetches a single record matching the given ID.\n",
      "    *   **`update_item(item_id, **kwargs)`:** A flexible update method. You pass the `item_id` and then keyword arguments (e.g., `name=\"New Name\", quantity=50`). It dynamically constructs the SQL `UPDATE` statement.\n",
      "    *   **`delete_item(item_id)`:** Removes a record by its ID.\n",
      "    *   **`search_items(query, search_by)`:** Allows searching by `name` or `category` using `LIKE` for partial matches.\n",
      "    *   **`get_low_stock_items(threshold)`:** Filters items by quantity less than or equal to a given threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Helper Functions:**\n",
      "    *   **`clear_screen()`:** Improves user experience by clearing the terminal output.\n",
      "    *   **`display_item(item)`:** Formats and prints details for a single item.\n",
      "    *   **`display_items_list(items)`:** Formats and prints a list of items, like a table.\n",
      "    *   **`get_positive_int_input()` / `get_positive_float_input()`:** Robust input functions with basic validation to ensure the user enters valid numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`main()` Function:**\n",
      "    *   Initializes the `InventoryManager`.\n",
      "    *   Presents a menu of options to the user in a loop.\n",
      "    *   Handles user input, calls the appropriate `InventoryManager` methods, and provides feedback.\n",
      "    *   Uses a `try-finally` block to ensure the database connection is always closed when the application exits.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Enhancements (Ideas for Future Development):\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **More Robust Input Validation:** Add more specific checks (e.g., unique item names if desired).\n",
      "*   **Batch Operations:** Add functionality to import/export inventory data (e.g., from/to CSV).\n",
      "*   **Reporting:** Generate summaries (e.g., total value of inventory, most/least stocked items).\n",
      "*   **User Interface:** Move from a console application to a GUI (e.g., using Tkinter, PyQt, or a web framework like Flask/Django).\n",
      "*   **Transaction Logging:** Keep a separate log of all changes (add, update, delete) to track inventory history.\n",
      "*   **Supplier Management:** Add a separate table for suppliers and link items to them.\n",
      "*   **Unit of Measure:** Add a field for \"unit\" (e.g., \"pcs\", \"kg\", \"liter\").\n"
